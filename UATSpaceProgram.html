<!-- Created by Michael Anderson-
This page was created in homage of the Artemis program recently reaching its first milestone. Since this is our first webpage (and milestone) for this class,
I wanted to parody the first archived NASA homepage.
You can find the link to that homepage here:

https://web.archive.org/web/19970711085416/http://www.nasa.gov/index_regular.html

I also wanted to see how difficult it would be to code a website like they did back in 1997, with keeping in mind that today's conventions are for responsive
design and accessibility. I used this website during the live classes to learn alongside and explore the ideas presented. This first website was definitely
fun to code, and I kept referring to the book, and W3C, for some of the parts that were tricking me. Check the revision history on GitHub to see what I mean.-->
