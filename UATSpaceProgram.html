<!-- Created by Michael Anderson-
This page was created in homage of the Artemis program in NASA. Since this is our first webpage for class, I wanted to parody the first archived NASA homepage.
You can find the link to that homepage here:

https://web.archive.org/web/19970711085416/http://www.nasa.gov/index_regular.html

I also wanted to see how difficult it would be to code a website like they did back in 1997, with keeping in mind that today's conventions are for responsive design and accessibility.
This first website for class was definitely fun to code, and I kept referring to the book, and W3C, for some of the parts that were tricking me. Check the revision history on GitHub to see what I mean.
I also used this website during the live classes to learn alongside and explore the ideas presented. That can also be reflected in my GitHub version history.

        <!--statement from "Introduction to the UAT Space Program (It's Real!) in Canvas - it summarizes the goal of the program succinctly and adds to the atmosphere of the website."-->
        <p>The goal of the UAT Space Program is to create a reusable spacecraft that can carry payloads for experiments to near outerspace. It will use a balloon for re-entry and landing and will collect data and pictures during the flight. It will also emit a signal so that when it lands, it can be recovered.</p>
