# UAT-Space-Program

This is a website that is being built in CSC102 - introduction to programming. The initial commit is meant to parody the first-archived NASA website. I hope you enjoy!

This version of the website uses loops and creates an animation for the initialization paragraph of the counter. It's still got an error easter egg hidden within, with a double click on a button producing the first site's inspirational error. The hardest thing for me to figure out was the timing of the keyframes for the animation in CSS, as adjusting the increments in an attempt to slow down the animation proved difficult. I finally found a version of the animation that i liked, through trial and error. I need to figure out if there is a way to combine loops from JavaScript to produce a CSS animation, or if CSS has its own loops that can be used in the animation - the implementation of this animation, while functional and a great attention grabber, is a little lengthy in my opinion.

Change Order Request - added the conditional and statement requested from the Admiral.

*Note. This website will produce an error if everything goes correctly. Pay attention to that error, and look beyond it!
