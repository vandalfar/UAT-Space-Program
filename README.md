# UAT-Space-Program

This is a website that is being built in CSC102 - introduction to programming. The initial commit is meant to parody the first-archived NASA website. I hope you enjoy!

This version of the website uses loops and creates an animation for the initialization paragraph of the counter. It's still got an error easter egg hidden within, with a double click on a button producing the first site's inspirational error. The hardest thing for me to figure out was the timing of the keyframes for the animation in CSS, as adjusting the increments in an attempt to slow down the animation proved difficult. I finally found a version of the animation that i liked, through trial and error. I need to figure out if there is a way to combine loops from JavaScript to produce a CSS animation, or if CSS has its own loops that can be used in the animation - the implementation of this animation, while functional and a great attention grabber, is a little lengthy in my opinion.

I'll admit that I have a bad habit of pushing several "final" versions with the same name - that's me editing comments to make them clearer, correct spelling, or even sometimes completely redesigning something as I read further into a particular attribute's parameters that I had used from my previous experience, as is what happened with the animation in this case. I made the animation with declaring my own name, initially ellipseDot, then blink, and finally initA because blink seemed to be a defined parameter? (VSC changed the color of the text to match other parameters when it shouldn't have if it were any other name).

This was a fun exercise in functions, though! I was able to quickly and easily code the timer to do the things that I wanted - and if you're quick about it, you can even get the timer to cancel with 0 seconds left!

*Note. This website will produce an error if everything goes correctly. Pay attention to that error, and look beyond it!
