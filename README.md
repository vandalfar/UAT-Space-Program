# UAT-Space-Program

This is a website that is being built in CSC102 - introduction to programming. The initial commit is meant to parody the first-archived NASA website. I hope you enjoy!

Wow. I learned a lot on this journey. Linking scripts to the HTML, creating new scripts for alerts, and even having some fun with the assignment parameters.

*Note. This website will produce an error if everything goes correctly. Pay attention to that error, and look beyond it!
